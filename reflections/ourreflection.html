        <p>Our experience with this piece of internet art was very fascinating. Olia Lialina was using a medium that was novel and future-forward. One of the most striking aspects of "My boyfriend came back from the war" is its use of the animated GIF format. Animated GIFs were a popular form of digital media in the early days of the internet, and Lialina's use of them in this piece is particularly effective. The GIFs create a sense of motion and movement that brings the story to life, and they also give the piece a distinctly internet aesthetic. The animation also creates greater engagement with viewers as it is dynamic. 

            Another aspect of the work that we were drawn to is the way it subverts the traditional narrative structure. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with different parts of the narrative appearing on different parts of the screen. This creates a sense of disorientation and fragmentation that mirrors the experience of war.</p>
        <p>In addition to its formal qualities, "My boyfriend came back from the war" also has a number of thematic concerns that are worth exploring. The work is an exploration of memory and trauma, and it raises questions about the relationship between personal experience and historical events. The narrative is told from the perspective of a woman who is waiting for her boyfriend to return from the war, and it explores the ways in which his experiences have changed him and their relationship.

            "My boyfriend came back from the war" is a thought-provoking work of internet art. Its use of animated GIFs and non-linear narrative structure make it a standout piece in the field, and its exploration of memory, trauma, and the relationship between personal experience and history continue to be relevant themes today.</p>
