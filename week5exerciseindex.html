        <p>“Personal Effects” by Solmaz Sharif explores the devastation that occurs due to war and how that impacts the lives of families. This poem details the emotional weight that is carried by those who lose loved ones to war as well as personal items that are left behind by victims. Sharif looks at the toll that is placed upon the victims of a war that is overlooked by those who have never experienced war.
          As I was reading this, I couldn’t help but get distracted by the way that this poem was structured. Stanzas were justified in different positions with differentiating spaces between lines. I wonder what the significance of this structuring may be.
          As an individual who learns about wars, I never thought about what it's like to firsthand experience it. I have been fortunate enough to never go through something like this and I hope that I never will, but that stops me from ever feeling empathy for those who had to witness their loved ones get attacked.
          This poem almost puts this into perspective by going into graphic details about the effects of war.
